# In this repository I do the sentiment analysis of some movie reviews
## The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/)
## And [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/enricopiffer/movie-review-sentiment-analysis) the link to the Kaggle notebook
## To do this project since there are many long reviews, I use the finetuning of the transformer achitecture. First of course I need to preprocess all the data in order to clean and organize them. The model with a small dataset finetuning reach an accuracy of 87% on the test set. When I finetune it on the bigger dataset it reach 93% accuracy
